    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/SkiPic.jpg" alt="Matt Picture" class="main-photo">
    <p>I am currently enrolled in coding boot camp at The University of Denver. This is the second time I have attended classes at the school. I graduated from the Daniels College of Business in 1999 with a BSBA in Finance. It is nice to be back. A lot has changed on campus. While living in Salt Lake City, I obtained an associates degree in geographic information systems from Salt Lake Community College.</p>
    <p>I work as the director of operations at Casino Party USA. We are a small Denver based company that specializes in providing casino themed events for fundraisers and corporate events. Our company puts on over 300 events each year. I love working in a small business environment and being faced with different tasks each day. </p>
    <p>One of my favorite things about living in Colorado is the access to some of the best skiing in the Country. I learned how to ski when I was 4, and have been lost in the mountains ever since. When it is too warm to ski, I take to the roads on a motorcycle.</p>
